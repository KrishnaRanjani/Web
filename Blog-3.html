                                    being a casualty of cyber crime might be most traumatic involvement for a woman.
                                    Particularly in India where the society looks down upon the woman, and the law
                                    doesn’t indeed legitimately perceive cyber crimes. Time is presently here to acquit
                                    that our women are secure in cyber world; the memento alarms to halt clowning around
                                    activities on web get to because it is an offense and women take umbrage from it.

                                    obscene representation of women are uncontrolled within the cyber world. In this
                                    paper we organize to examine upon the diverse sorts of cyber crimes that can be
                                    caused upon a woman, and they unfavourably influence her. We shall also briefly
                                    examine upon the different laws that exist to secure woman in such cases such as the
                                    Information Technology Act (2000).

                                    approached for recording complaints fair as the cyber crime cells specially assigned
                                    with the jurisdiction to enlist complaint. In addition, provisions have now been
                                    made for filing of 'E-FIR' in most of the states. Women security is a must and the

                                    by women and cognizance of the same must be taken very seriously.</p>

                                    officer who can quickly bargain with cyber crime complaints made. In case a police
                                    station denies enlist the complaint, a representation may be given to the
                                    commissioner of police/superintendent of police. If in spite of that action isn't
                                    taken, the following step seem either be a private complaint before the concerned
                                    court or a summons before the high court. “If There's Cyber Crime, Women Begin

                                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A major consequence of online abuse is the silencing

                                    spaces. A survey by Feminism in India, a digital platform, found that 28% of
                                    women who experienced online abuse said they intentionally reduced their online
                                    presence. Amnesty International conducted a study on online violence against
                                    women in 2017 which showed that more than 75% of women surveyed across eight

                                    media platforms. A third of women said they even stopped posting their opinion

                                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Women often find it difficult to report online abuse
                                    to the police for several reasons, ranging from not knowing the law to not
                                    trusting the criminal justice system. Of the women surveyed by Feminism in India
                                    who reported harassment to the authorities, only one in ten said they had
                                    received a helpful response. The National Crime Records Bureau says that around
                                    12,000 incidents of cyber-crimes were reported in 2016, and nearly the same

                                    positioned to take quick and effective action against abusers, are also known to
                                    fail to act. Amnesty’s survey indicated that women feel social media companies
                                    need to do more. Just 18% of women polled across all countries said that the
                                    responses of social media companies were very, fairly or completely adequate. In
                                    India, there have been a number of reports in the media about women who reported
                                    online abuse to social media platforms, but received highly unsatisfactory

                                <h3>Analysis Tools </h3>
                                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These tools are utilized to measure hazard. They measure
                                    what an incident did and how
                                    it was done and what the results were. Cases of investigation tools include the
                                    Coroners Toolkit that runs beneath NIX and Encase that runs beneath windows.</p>
                                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These include a specialized awareness through
                                    information of specialized suggestions of activities, an understanding of how data
                                    can be modified, cleverness, open-mindedness, deviousness, a tall standard of
                                    morals, proceeding instruction and the utilize of excess information sources. In
                                    case one doesn’t altogether get it or meet the over necessities, the framework can
                                    be left distant more regrettable than when at first compromised from a legal angle.
                                    It is like a activity cop investigating a murder scene. I would deliver a case of
                                    one of the told” EcCase”. It gives a recognizable Windows Explorer fashion view. The
                                    view shows records without changing them in any way, counting free space that
                                    contains erased records. The see sheet is additionally exceptionally supportive when
                                    sorting through many records. It contains a solid Report see which offer assistance
                                    agents construct a case as they continue. It too permits point and tap record
                                    hashing; a priceless apparatus to verify records afterward.</p>

                                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The reason of the ultimate organ of the cyber crimes
                                    division is to police the web to guarantee that certain cyber crimes can be stopped
                                    some time recently their commission. For this reason, the Network Monitoring Centre
                                    has been provided with a Network Monitoring Tool, created by I.I.T. Kanpur. It is
                                    additionally utilized to permit comparative devices to attain such a purpose.</p>

                                <h3>A) SIEM tool</h3>
                                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Machine Learning & Deep Learning based SIEM tool for
                                    numerous professionals, SOC still implies SIEM tool and security observing and to a
                                    few degrees that's redress as the SIEM tool acts as a core engine of the SOC, which
                                    collects the logs from the integrated log sources, forms those logs as per the
                                    predefined rule and give the alerts</p>
                                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since the beginning of the SIEM tool security
                                    engineers/analysts are putting in parts of distinctive rules to screen and relate
                                    the log information pumped into the SIEM instrument. These rules are included one by
                                    one as per the environment necessities</p>
                                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since of the amount of log data that must be prepared by
                                    the SIEM apparatus, it is impossible to generate the rule that can distinguish the
                                    anomalies. The next generation SIEM tools will be utilizing machine learning which
                                    is basically marrying the rules or algorithms with the measurements that can be
                                    utilized for making knowledge-based, intelligent investigation that will deliver
                                    prescient noteworthy results</p>

                                <h3>B) Wearing the Hackers Hat — AI primarily based Sandbox</h3>
                                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hackers are constantly ahead of security defence bunches,
                                    utilize the innovation to perform investigation of focused on client’s environment
                                    to spot the vulnerabilities to anticipate exploitability. This same technique
                                    security analyst will use by utilizing AI and ML-based sandboxing tool, which will
                                    be a proactive approach and a defensive one too. this could offer knowledge-based
                                    inputs to the analyst to counter the probable security attacks and shield the system
                                    from potential security risks.</p>
                                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A Security Operations Centre (SOC) is characterised each
                                    as a group, typically operating in shifts round the clock, and a facility dedicated
                                    to and arranged to stop, detect, judge and respond to cyber security threats and
                                    incidents, and to fulfil and survey administrative compliance.</p>
                                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All these progressions within the innovation zone don't
                                    dispose of the require for making the natural educated decisions by the human brain.
                                    We still need to have security investigator to see into the occurrences and finalize
                                    the activity plan. The life of these analysts will be made simple by liberating them
                                    from the tedious unremarkable tasks and they can utilize their time and intelligence
                                    in characterizing and executing the occurrence reaction arrange to decrease the
                                    impact.</p>

                                <h3>C) AI and machine learning can boost cyber defences</h3>
                                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As artificial intelligence and machine learning gathers
                                    pace, and begins to affect increasingly businesses, it’s beyond any doubt to play a
                                    greater part in cyber security. Since the fight with cyber criminals moves so
                                    rapidly, machine learning models that can anticipate and accurately identify attacks
                                    quickly may well be a genuine boon for InfoSec experts. These models got to be
                                    prepared and sharpened. In any case, there's moreover a risk that AI and machine
                                    learning may be misused by attackers</p>
                                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; According to a survey every month 7000 cyber crimes are
                                    happened, but in national crime record bureau less than 1000 crimes have been
                                    reported. So, there is huge mismatch between actual crime happen and crimes
                                    reported. Cybercrime reporting in India is still in its nascent stage though cyber
                                    violence is fast growing. Our laws need to be changed to make them cyber-sensitive
                                    as well as gender-sensitive. Words like lascivious and prurient should be dropped
                                    from the concerned Act to make them better secure women’s equality and dignity. The
                                    perspective of the laws should be to ensure dignity of women and not being in a
                                    paternalistic role. Cybercrimes against women needs a holistic approach with change
                                    in laws, change in approach of officials and more intense sensitization campaigns
                                    involving different sections of society. Indian women netizens are still not open to
                                    quickly report the cyber mishandle or cyber-crime. This nature gives the guilty
                                    parties the chance to elude after the commission of cyber-crime. The issue would be
                                    unravelled only when the victimized woman at that point and there report back or
                                    indeed caution the abuser around taking strong activities.</p>
